Assignment 4 - Creative Coding: Interactive Multimedia Experiences
===

Due: October 2nd, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment we will focus on client-side development using popular audio/graphics/visualization technologies. The goal of this assignment is to refine our JavaScript knowledge while exploring the multimedia capabilities of the browser.

Baseline Requirements
---

Your application is required to implement the following functionalities:

- A server created using Express. This server can be as simple as needed.
- A client-side interactive experience using at least one of the following web technologies frameworks.
  - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A library for 3D graphics / VR experiences
  - [D3.js](https://d3js.org): A library that is primarily used for interactive data visualizations
  - [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API): A 2D raster drawing API included in all modern browsers
  - [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API): A 2D vector drawing framework that enables shapes to be defined via XML.
  - [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API): An API for audio synthesis, analysis, processing, and file playback.
- A user interface for interaction with your project, which must expose at least four parameters for user control. [tweakpane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) is highly recommended for this, but you can also use regular HTML `<input>` tags (the `range` type is useful to create sliders). You might also explore interaction by tracking mouse movement via the `window.onmousemove` event handler in tandem with the `event.clientX` and `event.clientY` properties. Consider using the [Pointer Events API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) to ensure that that both mouse and touch events will both be supported in your app.
- Your application should display basic documentation for the user interface when the application first loads.

The interactive experience should possess a reasonable level of complexity. Some examples:
### Three.js
- A generative algorithm creates simple agents that move through a virtual world. Your interface controls the behavior / appearance of these agents.
- A simple 3D game... you really want this to be a simple as possible or it will be outside the scope of this assignment.
- An 3D audio visualization of a song of your choosing. User interaction should control aspects of the visualization. 
### Canvas
- Implement a generative algorithm such as [Conway's Game of Life](https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) (or 1D cellular automata) and provide interactive controls. Note that the Game of Life has been created by 100s of people using `<canvas>`; we'll be checking to ensure that your implementation is not a copy of these.
- Design a 2D audio visualizer of a song of your choosing. User interaction should control visual aspects of the experience. 
### Web Audio API
- Create a screen-based musical instrument using the Web Audio API. You can use projects such as [Interface.js](http://charlie-roberts.com/interface/) or [Nexus UI](https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/api/#Piano) to provide common musical interface elements, or use dat.GUI in combination with mouse/touch events (use the Pointer Events API). Your GUI should enable users to control aspects of sound synthesis. If you want to use higher-level instruments instead of the raw WebAudio API sounds, consider trying the instruments provided by [Tone.js]() or [Gibber](https://github.com/charlieroberts/gibber.audio.lib).
### D3.js
- Create visualizations using the datasets found at [Awesome JSON Datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/Awesome-JSON-Datasets). Experiment with providing different visualizations of the same data set, and providing users interactive control over visualization parameters and/or data filtering. Alternatively, create a single visualization with using one of the more complicated techniques shown at [d3js.org](d3js.org) and provide meaningful points of interaction for users.

Deliverables
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a4-firstname-lastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. *NOTE: If you don't use Glitch for hosting (where we can see the files) then you must include all project files that you author in your repo for this assignment*.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a4-firstname-lastname`.

Sample Readme (delete the above when you're ready to submit, and modify the below so with your links and descriptions)

## Your Web Application Title

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.
